## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS - Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) - For form validation
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - For checking the design


### What I learned

- This was the first project where I had to make two complete pages directly from a Figma design. 
- I learned to validate and style forms.
- An extra work was made for checking that, for accessibility, the site is well display with zoom up to 200% and browser default font size up to 32px.

### Continued development

Styled-Components was a very useful tool, but I have to learned more about it. It has a lot of functionalities that can be very helpful for customizing styles.
